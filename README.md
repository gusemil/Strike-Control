# Strike-Control
2nd year 3D Real Time Strategy Game project

* Team Size: 6 (4 programmers, 2 artists)
* Responsibilities: Project Leader, Lead Game Designer, Programmer (Resource Gathering and Player Resources, Enemy Spawning, Factions, 50% of unit AI code) 
* Other: Made in 8 weeks during Game Project course. Due lack of time the unit movement and combat are clumsy but otherwise it is a very functional game.

* **Take note that the whole game and its files are too large to host on GitHub, thus I have included a dropbox link with full source code and executable**
